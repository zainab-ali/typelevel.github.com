A couple of days ago, the new [Scala Code of Conduct](https://contributors.scala-lang.org/t/please-read-scala-code-of-conduct/28) was published.
It applies to all official Scala channels, including mailing lists, Gitter channels and GitHub repositories.
We would like to take this opportunity to endorse this new Code of Conduct.
From our perspective, it does a good job of listing encouraged behaviour, instead of just banning harassment: It reflects the goal of _actively_ creating a welcoming community.
Also, we consider it to be a decent substitute of our own [Code of Conduct](/conduct.html).
That means that Typelevel project maintainers are free to switch to the Scala Code of Conduct if they wish.

For some more background, please see the [discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/typelevel/general/issues/51).
