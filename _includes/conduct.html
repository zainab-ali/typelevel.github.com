Harassment includes offensive comments related to gender or anything to do with it (identity, history, expression, non-binary gender, etc.), sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, programming experience or background, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of community activities, spaces, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

All participants in the community and community-associated activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, participants and community organizers should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the community.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the community staff immediately. A contact address can be found <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about.html">here</a>.

Community staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe. We value your participation.
